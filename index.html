		<p>Hello, world. I am Zion in Zion. Welcome to my website!</p>
		<p align="justify">What does <b>"Zion in Zion"</b> mean? First of all, my name is Zion. That is the first "Zion." The second "Zion" refers to what is mentioned in Psalm 132:13 and Isaiah 30:18. They read, "For Jehovah has chosen Zion; / He has desired it for His habitation" and "For a people will dwell in Zion..." Zion in the Bible signifies the dwelling place of God and His chosen people. Actually, Zion is the mutual dwelling place of God and man within each other. God becomes the dwelling place of His people and the people of God become the dwelling place of their God (Psalm 90:1; Isaiah 66:1-2; John 14:20). Hence, the phrase, "Zion in Zion" describes the wonderful promise according to the Bible, the precious reality that I am living today as a foretaste, and the glorious future God and man will enjoy in full for eternity. <i><u>Please, <a href="mailto:zionpark93@gmail.com?subject=Tell me more!&body=I would like to hear more about it!">email</a> me if you would like to find out more about this amazing fact!</u></i></p>
